# Bankruptcy and Collections Policy

Applicants with adverse credit history are evaluated carefully.

## Bankruptcy
- Chapter 7: Must be discharged for at least 4 years
- Chapter 13: Must be discharged for at least 2 years

## Collections
- Open collections may impact approval
- Medical collections may be excluded at underwriter discretion

Bankruptcy history does not automatically disqualify applicants.
